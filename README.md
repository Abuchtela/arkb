# arkb
Arweave Deploy that saves you data costs.

## Features
- No file size limit.
- No amount of files limit.
- Doesn't upload files that you have already uploaded.

## How to use
arkb runs using NodeJS and NPM. You must have both installed on your machine for it to work.

Install arkb:
```
npm install -g arkb
```

And run:
```
arkb help
```

> **Note:** If you are planning to upload large batches of data transactions to the Arweave network, it is *strongly* advised that you use the `--use-bundler` option instead of regular deploy to avoid transaction failures. You can read about bundles and their advantages on the [Arwiki](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/preview/WUAtjfiDQEIqhsUcHXIFTn5ZmeDIE7If9hJREBLRgak).
